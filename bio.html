	</p>
	<p id="text_header">Present:</p>
	<p id="text">
		I currently am a Freshman at Tufts University in Medford, MA. My major is undecided, but I intend to major in Computer Science and perhaps minor in Classics or Music. Outside of classes, I fence saber with the Tufts' Men's Fencing Team and play clarinet in Tufts' Symphony Orchestra and Wind Ensemble.

	<p id="text_header">Hobbies:</p>
	<p id="text">
		In what litte free time I have between classes, fencing and playing clarinet, I enjoy hiking, playing board/card/video games with my friends, and sketching. I also enjoy listening to music, especially classic rock, but I'll listen to electronic music and classical music from time to time as well.
